Authors of TurboParser.
=======================

André Martins designed and implemented TurboParser and TurboTagger. Some of 
the architecture is based on MSTParser, which was written by Jason Baldridge and
Ryan McDonald. The file logval.h was written by Chris Dyer. The decoder of 
TurboParser is based on the AD3 library, which was written by André Martins. 
TurboParser and TurboTagger use the Eigen template library for linear algebra,
a project started by Benoît Jacob and Gaël Guennebaud; and the Google libraries 
glog and gflags, for logging and commandline flags processing.
